# Sort

## What Does the Program Do?
This Java program serves as a demonstration of various sorting algorithms. It allows users to interactively choose a sorting method and visually represent the sorting process on a randomly generated array. The implemented sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Heap Sort. Users can exit the application when desired.

## What I Learned
- In developing this program, I gained hands-on experience with:
- Java programming language
- Implementing and understanding common sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Heap Sort)
- User input handling and interactive console-based applications
- Class structure and method organization in Java

## How Could I Improve It?
- Expand Sorting Algorithms: Include additional sorting algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort) for a more comprehensive overview.
- Allow users to compare the performance of different algorithms on the same dataset.
- Documentation: Improve code comments to make the codebase more understandable for others or for future reference.
- Unit Testing: Create unit tests to ensure the correctness of each sorting algorithm.
- Optimization: Explore opportunities to optimize the sorting algorithms for better performance on larger datasets.
